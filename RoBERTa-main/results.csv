I would say Charlotte Tilbury's skincare is more aimed at prepping your skin for makeup and it really reflects the ingredients. Okay, starting off in last place, what I don't think is worth your money is the Glow Toner with Nye Cinema. For $55, you can get a much better Nye Cinema Toner. It's kind of thick, it's not as runny as you would think. You might like this if you have oily skin or if your skin really likes Nye Cinema. I will say this feels really nice and hydrating but for me personally, it wasn't a standout product and the fragrance is really, really strong. In seventh place, we have the facial oil. Okay, we'll say that this oil is really beautiful, the texture is amazing, it has some nice cushion to it. This cushion effect is from the Silica Dime Thylsillolate which is an oil thickener. I mean this doesn't feel greasy at all, it has a lovely texture but the reason why it's in seventh place is because of the fragrance. This smells so strongly of lavender so if you have sensitive skin and you don't like essential oils, this is not for you. It gives your skin such a nice glow but you can smell that fragrance for days. Also for me, I'm not really an oil person so that's kind of why I put it in seventh place. In sixth place, we have the Body Lotion. There's actually a really expensive active in here called the Algactyb uplift. When I used to work with it, it was like upwards of $4,000 a kilo. This adge of helps with firming but I presume it's in there at such a low level that you'll have to use this really consistently to see any results. I like that this doesn't lead my skin feeling tacky but I do notice like this slight film on your skin when it dries. I think that film kind of goes away but if you're not someone that likes that feeling of lotion on their skin, I don't think you'll like this. But other than that, it is super hydrating and it feels like a very rich lotion. In fourth and fifth place, I couldn't decide which one I liked more or less. I'm gonna give this one fifth place, this is the Multi-Miracle Glow. Cans are mask and balm. Confusing, right? I was trying to figure out how to use this for the longest time because it's marketed as three different products. But personally, I think the best way to use this is as a overnight mask. This formula is nice and thick. Glisterin is actually the first ingredient in this formula. We all know that Glisterin is an amazing humectant which is why I think this will work well as an overnight mask but I would wash it off in the morning because it leaves behind like just a slight tacky feeling. This does leave your skin feeling really soft and it is nice and cooling so maybe I would use this after like a long day out in the sun. Alright, go to part two for the rest of my rankings.",NEGATIVE,0.998734176158905

7187538299395902762,No,Positive," Thank you Sephora for getting me an addiction. Wish I had a little bit of it. I have now successfully gotten both the Magic Serum and the Magic Cream. I have been using the Magic Serum for about two weeks now and I can definitely say that I feel a lot more firmness in my skin. It's also a lot brighter in complexion and it just feels really good once the product is on. I haven't used the Magic Cream yet but I want to use it today for my makeup and since I already have a full-less filter and the airbrush full-less I thought that it would be really good to put these to the test and see if they are worth the money. I can already say this alone is worth the money. I also use this at night consistently and I love it. So you're supposed to apply two to three drops so I just do one on my forehead and then one on each cheek. So I just put it on and as you can see it gives a nice glow to the skin. It has hyaluronic acid in it so it's really going to hydrate your skin. I know I look super tired. I literally just woke up and I have work so we're going to beat my face and see if that makes me look any better. I also will say with the Magic Serum it smells expensive which is nice because it is expensive. The packaging is to die for obviously Charlotte never failed with that. I will be mixing the Magic Cream with the summer Fridays sheer tint just because I like a little bit more tan on my skin right now because it's winter and I'm pale. I think I'm just going to dip my finger in like that and then just place and then mix in this. This stuff smells really good. It might just be me but I really like the smell and I'm literally just going to do one doll of that. So this Magic Cream is definitely an investment. It is a hundred dollars for fifty milliliters but I will say they do have a refill option and set up just like barring a new container gun which is nice and I think that one is like twenty dollars cheaper so yeah it's still expensive but I've heard amazing amazing results with it. Off the bat in brush in my skin feels great. It's not extremely tight because the Magic Serum really makes my skin feel tight. This makes my skin feel super moisturized and bouncy. Okay, now that's one of my face. I'm going to put on the Fallow's filter first and then the Airbrush Foundation. I'm also not realizing I probably should have done half and half so you guys could see but I also did a work so I don't want to look like trash. Okay, you guys, my Fallow's filter is on and my skin is giving for sure. I'm going to go ahead and put on the Airbrush Fallow's I wear the shade six. So I know I also just love her packaging so much it makes it more worth it to me to buy her products because of the packaging. Okay, the foundation is on. I'm going to set my face with her powder and then do the rest of my face and then I'll be right back. Okay, you guys, I'm finished and I think Charlotte knows exactly what she's doing with these products. It's a match like a complete match made in heaven for me. So I think there were a lot of them.",POSITIVE,0.9988678693771362

Is it worth a hundred dollars for a hyaluronic acid-based moisturizer? I don't think so. I feel like this cleanser is low-key to become my nemesis because it was so overhyped and I saved my money for so long to purchase. And when I did, I was so disappointed. Not only is it very expensive, it is so stripping like I would take a drugstore cleanser over this any day. I don't think you could make a more irritating product if you tried.

But if you're wearing makeup, in my opinion, there is no better moisturizer in the world. It's going to make your makeup glide on as naturally and it's going to give you a beautiful base for your makeup that is going to last all day. This is the Charlotte Tilbury Charlotte's Magic Cream and it's kind of legendary on the makeup scene because it was created especially for people working in the industry at first. I'm going to be fully honest with you. I received the first one in PR because before this I would never go for a $90 face cream. But then I tried it and I got myself another one and now I ordered my third one. There is another simple makeup product out there that is going to make your skin look as glowy and as dewy. Even if you apply a full face makeup, it's just going to glide beautifully onto this. You can also wear it on your own right now. I'm not wearing any makeup and my skin is so glowy and dewy but it doesn't feel oily. Honestly, I wish I could say there is a cute for this. If anybody knows one, please let me know. But for me, this moisturizer is truly one of a kind and one of those luxury items that I would actually recommend.",POSITIVE,0.9989156723022461

7224520969040284955,No,Neutral," I'm gonna test out Charlotte Tilbury's magic cream. I feel like this has a lot of hype, obviously has a makeup primer and as a moisturizer. Firstly, I'm not sure exactly what a 50 pound moisturizer can add to your routine, but obviously it's worth trying out. I did actually get gifted this by my friend Beth, so I luckily didn't have to pay 50 pounds for it. Texture is a lot kind of thicker looking than I expected like this. I'm not sure how much is a good amount to use, so I'm just gonna, that feels like a good amount actually. It is a little bit perfumed, so I'm not sure how that would kind of sit on sensitive skin, but I have pretty dry skin and so far it feels really nice on the face, it doesn't feel too sticky. Does my face look like it's instantly turned around? Now I assume the Charlotte Tilbury foundations are made to kind of go over this cream, so I'm gonna try a different foundation with this. This is the Borgioire Healthy Mix. I actually feel like this is a pretty good dupe for the Charlotte Tilbury Beautiful Skin Foundation. It's looking pretty good. I don't feel like I'm having problems with how the foundation is sitting, although I feel like usually I like it a little bit better, so I don't know if that's really to do with the cream or not. But my face does feel really moisturised. Just looking at it again actually, I don't think there is an issue with the way the foundation has applied. So yeah, I mean, I'm not really sure what there is to say about this, I think it's a really nice moisturizer. It works really nicely as a moisturizing primer, and I'm sure it works really nicely as a moisturizer by itself as well. Maybe it's one of those things that I kind of have to use over a long period of time to really see a difference and also you're supposed to apply it with a Charlotte Tilbury Tap technique or whatever it's called, which is like a five minute face massage, which I could not be bothered to do. So maybe I need to try that as well. But is it worth 50 pounds? I'm really not sure that it is. You know, if you really want a moisturised base, you could just use the Ember Release Cream or really any moisturizer to be honest. But if you have the money to spend then this did feel really nice on the face, so go for it. Let me know if you've tried this and whether it's your holy grail or not, and thanks for watching.",POSITIVE,0.9952346682548523
7179670529115196677,No,Positive," If this $450 skincare routine worth it in my opinion, Hi my name is Hanna and I review luxury, girl-least skincare and makeup, so if you like that kind of stuff, follow me. I want to start by saying that this is the honest review, I'm not being paid to say this, it's only my true opinion. These are all shallot-till-berry products and I'm going to start with both the magic greens. When I first tried the magic night cream, I didn't know that it was a night cream. So when I opened it, I was like, what is this color? This is not the usual color that I see on my furry page. That's because it's the night cream. This is the normal magic cream. It's much more of a moose-seeing light kind of consistency, although it's quite rich, but this, whoa, this felt like kind of slimy, which I first to be honest, I did not like at all because I was not used to it, but right now I enjoy it so much. So they both retail for 125 Canadian each. They come in this gorgeous packaging, and they are refillable, which not many people know. In my opinion, these are both extremely worth it, especially the night cream. I live in Canada, and as you all know, the Canadian winter is harsh. This saves my skin every single night. When I wake up, my skin feels so hydrated. I never tried anything like this. So if you have dry skin, I really, really recommend it. As for the dead cream, I recommend it because this lasts so long. Last texture, it's just so luxurious. I love it.",POSITIVE,0.998906135559082
7190488588470078763,No,Positive," Charlotte Tilbury, if you see this, I want you to know. I may be late to the party, but I'm here to stay. My 17 year old daughter bought the Charlotte Tilbury's magic cream and she was like, ma, you have to try this. Look at my skin and I looked at her and you know when your eyes bug out sometimes when you're like, wow, wow, her skin looked so beautiful and flawless, but at 17, for the most part, you're supposed to have nice skin at that age. She insisted, no, ma, you have to try, you're gonna love it. So I did. Let me say something. This moisturizer is the bomb diggerie. You guys do know what the bomb diggerie is. This cream is powered by the Magic 8 Patriots. We all remember the Matrix, right? Keanu Reeves? That movie was life changing for me. It is filled with all of the skincare ingredients that I look for when I wanna achieve a more luminous, plumper-looking skin. So I'm extending to one. Let me give you a breakdown. It's got peptides, vitamin C, E, Rosehip oil, which I love, hyaluronic acid, which I need, aloe vera, shea butter. It's got another oil in it and it's got a flower extract, which honestly I can't pronounce and I don't even know what it does. It feels nourishing. Looks like it's thick, but it applies lightweight. Super hydrating. It's not greasy at all. It almost feels velvety. The Charlotte's Magic Matrix Cream is now on my anti-aging skincare roster. Bomb diggerie.",POSITIVE,0.9987980127334595

It's a really rich moisturizer. It's pretty occlusive. I love the fragrance of it. That has a lot to do with the reason why I like this so much. I'm very nostalgic when I smell it. It reminds me of being a beauty editor and, I don't know, there's just something about it. I really like it, but it's a very solid, rich moisturizer. It works really well under makeup as a rich moisturizer. And I think that's a big deal to me because you can't use every really rich moisturizer under makeup because sometimes it can make your makeup too slippy slightly. This does set down pretty well. It does have a peptide complex in it that helps it to be a good moisturizer. It just feels like a really good solid moisturizer that happens to be a rich moisturizer that you can wear under makeup.",POSITIVE,0.9989262223243713

And we always used Nivia and Nivia's soft cream growing up, and I think this is the exact same thing. It smells exactly the same. Tell me if I'm wrong. I mean, I love it.

I'm gonna go ahead and apply it. It smells like a moisturizer, a standard moisturizer. What you would think like a drugstore moisturizer smells like, not a bad way. It's like a clean, nice scent. Whoa, I just looked at myself. I didn't even use that much. And I feel like I instantly look glowy. I am applying makeup today, so I'm gonna see how that works with my makeup. So far, very impressed.

7188203481180966149,No,Negative," This is my review of the Charlotte Tilbury Magic Cream. I only give it five out of ten actually and here's why. I object to any cream being called Magic for a start. I think that that creates such a kind of misleading idea about what skincare can do. Skincare works not through magic but through consistency, through application of amazing, clinically evidenced ingredients, not magic ingredients every single day. There's no one magic ingredient, it's using a whole host and variety of protective, nourishing and fortifying ingredients. I use this cream for a wee and I use it alongside the Magic Serum and the Magic Eye Cream because I understand that they were all designed to work in synergy. I actually found this cream very irritating. Quite a few times I had to remove it all. My eyes were streaming with water so that's probably something that's the sensitivity of my skin. And it may be the SPF that's really reacting, the chemical SPF in this cream. But something didn't agree with me, that's for sure. The Magic Cream has an SPF of 15. Now I think that 15 in a day cream is just too low. I'm much prefer a day cream with a 30 or a 50 because in reality the amount that people put onto their skin if it's a 15 is probably going to amount to about five protection. And to be fair, it does have nice ingredients, it's got hyaluronic acid, it's got peptides, some lovely antioxidants and good hydrating ingredients. So it does have that. I guess my main complaint was it's quite thick, it doesn't really absorb very well into the skin, it's quite greasy. So for someone like me, this is not the kind of thing that I would use as a go-to. So I'm not a lover of the Magic Cream. And the fragrance is quite overwhelming, you can smell it for many hours later in the day. I don't mind fragrance products but it might be something that you don't like, so be aware of that. So for the same price I think there are probably definitely better options. So sorry folks, no magic here.",NEGATIVE,0.9993639588356018
7166668047367834886,No,Negative," Today I'm gonna give you my first impressions of the Charlotte Tilbury Magic Cream. I have been hearing so much hype on TikTok about this stuff. Apparently it really is magic for anti-aging and acne. I'm gonna give you my honest first impressions of the product. So first off, it is very very thick. It almost kind of has the texture. If you've ever had a cream like sitting in your drawer unused for like two years and it kind of like gets thick, that's honestly kind of what it feels like. But then once you start to rub it in your skin and it gets all warmed up, it does feel a lot more blendable. It is a very thick cream so definitely good for the night time versus the morning and I do have this comical burn under my eye so hopefully it is gentle on that. So first impressions, I feel like I had to use a lot of the cream because it's very thick and like I said it feels almost like it's like a dried out old cream. I kind of had to use a lot because it didn't spread very well and honestly my skin feels a little bit sticky. It doesn't feel that hydrated compared to my other moisturizers. It's a first impression, a seven out of ten. It's all right. It does have a little bit of a fragrance which like I always say I do not like fragrance in skincare products. But the real test will be after using it for a few days, few weeks and see how my skin looks. So my first impression was not living up to the hype that it's had on TikTok but maybe I'll eventually start to like it more the more I use it.",POSITIVE,0.9969017505645752

I can't say enough good things. It does kind of have like, I don't know how to say this in a nice way, but like, a scent that maybe my grandma would wear. It's that bad to say, I don't know. Okay, you know what I'm talking about. It's a more established, older perfume smell, but it goes on amazing, so smooth, so hydrating.

7233353126437211394,No,Positive," Can you do a detailed review on the Charlotte Tilbury Magic Cream and serum? Darling, but of course, my English accent is not giving it all. I'm going to give my very, very honest opinion about these two products. Popular, they're trending, a lot of people love them. Both these products have fragrance in the ingredient list, which is very natural and expected for a luxury brand. It's part of the experience that make you feel like these products are really bougie and expensive. And you know what? I'm not mad at it. I personally do not like fragrance in my skincare, especially in a leave on product like a serum or a moisturizer. Why is my collar so wrinkly? I mean, I'm reviewing luxury skincare. I should look presentable. I'm back to the formulas and let's start with the serum. Near the top of the ingredient list, you have ingredients like niacinamide, glycerin, t-seed oil. It also has lactic acid and vitamin C, but that's more towards the bottom of the ingredient list. It's not a bad serum and has some great ingredients. And for me personally, the fragrance did not irritate my skin, but does that mean it's a standout product and does it make it unique? I don't know about that. I mean, I'm sure Cater Swift's certain audience, but you can get a serum that has a very similar formula for a fraction of the price. It does make your skin feel a bit tacky, so I'm assuming this is a great primer for makeup. The magic cream. This is crazy expensive. I almost put this in my makeup kit for clients, but I'm kind of getting selfish and I want to keep it all to myself. The texture that this moisturizer has and like the slip in glide it has on your skin when you apply it, there is something in this formula, something in the ingredient list. I don't know how they did this, maybe it's the type of amoliance that they use. Quite literally feels like butter on my skin. It's a thicker consistency, so people would dry skin, might enjoy this more. I have oily skin and I love it, feels very hydrating and look at this beautiful glow that it leaves. Do you need a really expensive moisturizer? Absolutely not. But would this be a really nice splurge? Absolutely. Don't just take my word, do your own research before you spend money on really expensive skincare.",POSITIVE,0.9987762570381165

Now I can't go a day on TikTok without being told I'm 109 right? But I'm actually only 42. But that does make me a more mature woman so I've got different skin needs.

I thought I'd chuck in an eyebrow pencil some mascara all sort of geared toward people with difficult skin and sensitive skin because I have that in abundance. And I'm wearing it now. And as you can see by this glow it just looked like I've just had a really good time. Janona Moon! So let's talk about the product. Here it is. Now it's 50 quid. It's not cheap ladies. Janona Moon and I am not an influencer on bags so 50 quid to me is a lot of money but is it worth it? You're done right it fucking is. It's so good. I can't believe it. I've been using it for three days and the difference is insane. My makeup doesn't crack. It doesn't look cakey anymore. It looks smoother. It's absolutely insane. Charlotte Tilbury, you get my vote on this. What they also do which I quite like is a free zoom consultation. I had one with a girl called Lorna. She was brilliant. She taught me through the right colour for my skin. Where I'd been going wrong with my brows. And honestly it's free. It's well worth rocking up for. And I've got to say as a mother that always puts herself last, your skin is an investment not because I'm vain and I don't want to look old. I don't care about that. But because it was actually sore and it was unpleasant to look at and honestly it made me feel really self conscious. So when I think about that 50 quid for a bit more self confidence it's not a bad swap. So if you think you benefit I recommend it and I finally now realise that having a duet complexion has got nothing to do with your bloodline.",POSITIVE,0.9986951947212219
7114088725809777925,No,Positive," Alright, so I'm gonna do a review today on the Charlotte Tilbury Magic Cream. It's pretty big. It's super, super expensive. Um, like over a hundred bucks. But hey, I got it doing this before I sale. Ooh, looks nice. So let's see how it is. Everyone always raves about this online. It's everywhere. So let's see how it is. Ooh, it's so soft. It kind of smells like nivia. But, oh, it's really soft. And it's like not too sticky. I like it so far. Let's see how it works under my makeup. So I've been wearing it all day under my makeup. I went to a party. I danced a lot. It didn't crease that much, which I really, really like. And it was really, really hydrating. So, it's a win for me.",POSITIVE,0.9985777139663696
7222437628287814958,No,Positive, So lately I've been using the Shalate Tilbury magic body cream and I've been doing the 30-day challenge So you basically document or mentally document the changes of your skin with using this cream every single day So I've been putting on my elbows because elbows try up and we don't really moisturize them I've been putting it on my shoulders. I had a lot of dryness and flakiness here on my neck And so I would start putting it here like on my collarbone area and it's just kind of anywhere where I thought that there was dryness And just doing this I was single day I started seeing results after a week and now like a month in Literally there's no dryness. I think feels so smooth. It feels as if I'm wearing cream right now And the flakiness is gone and I don't know how that happened because I never changed anything in my daily routine Except putting the cream on every day like I would still tan. I still use the same products Everything stayed the same in my hygiene routine. I just would implement this cream every single morning You don't have to put so much you don't have to put it all over your body like you don't just soak in In it but just to put it wherever you feel that there's dryness or possibly irritation Wouldn't use it on the face never have because it's meant for the body But the Charlotte Tilbury body cream I'm at magic cream for the face is amazing I use that dilate on my face to my eyes. I feel so smooth youthful and just very hydrated and alive Definitely would get totally tired out of my command and thank you Charlotte Tilbury for the PR,POSITIVE,0.9989047050476074
7186727451723058433,No,Positive," Hello! I wanted to share with you guys my experience of using the Magic Cream since I got a sample. This cream is quite famous for giving that instinct glow before makeup. So let's try it out. My first impression of the Magic Cream that it's definitely heavier, I could feel a difference in hydration immediately. It's also much thicker to spread out. I also blow foundation on to test it for a few hours. My skin usually gets dry after a while, especially after putting on makeup, but this cream solves that problem, so I'll keep using it as a primer.",POSITIVE,0.9986876845359802
7143315233795411206,No,Negative," Today I'm gonna try the Charlotte Tilbury Magic Cream for the first time on my rosacea because I think it's so easy to say that something is a miracle worker on a perfect skin already. So this is the ultimate test. Now this cream promises to be a moisturizer that instantly turns around dull and hard skin. Excuse me, well, I'm just kept a couple about this, but let's try never the last. I like the feeling of it. So I'm looking at my hand right now, and I think this moisturizer contains some pearlescents, particles that will contribute to blurring your skin. All right guys, I don't dislike it, but I also think that this is not going to look good on oily skin. I will let it sit and see how it works on my skin. Hey, I don't think it made me so oily as I thought it would now. I wouldn't call it an instant miracle worker. I don't think that there is anything that can justify the steep price.",NEGATIVE,0.9988439083099365
7194925882870385925,No,Positive," Okay, I feel like this one is a bit of a love or a hate for most people. Some people swear by this as their pre-foundation moisturizer. Some people just can't get on with it. So I decided to test it out and see how well it hydrated my dehydrated skin. It actually did really well. It does have a few acne triggers, but it's great on dry skin.",POSITIVE,0.9985986351966858
6990818542262226181,No,Positive," I need no one. You're exciting boy, confining. Okay, her skin looks gorgeous. She's using the Charlotte Tilbury Magic Serum Crystal Elexer. So I'm sure she's been using it over time as he would with any skincare. It's not going to be like an instant result, but I want to put it to the test and see how it looks after one use. I currently don't have anything on my skin, so let's see if this does something. So it says it's a Crystal Infuse Replexium Serum for Younger Looking Miracle Skin. Okay, let's try it out. Okay, it definitely gives you a pretty glow. I also have the Charlotte Tilbury Magic Cream, so I'm going to put that on top. My skin is literally glowing.

7098279023851097349,No,Neutral," Okay, I need some assistance. Has any of you skincare girlies ever tried the Charlotte Tilbury magic cream? Like it's iconic. It's everywhere. I see in all her Instagram videos. I'm sucker for and I obviously That's tried out, but I'm scared because my skin can break out quite easily and this is rich and it's got such mixed reviews So what do you girls think? Thank you so much",NEGATIVE,0.9931772947311401
7182239739980958982,No,Neutral," Yesterday I went to SACS and I got some shallots Hilary products. I got four products in total, two completely new that I haven't tried and two refills that are like my favorite. I got a refill of the shallots Hilary's setting spray. This was like a limited edition packaging collection, I think, so I was like sure. And I'm also running out at home, so I got it. Also a refill on the setting powder. For the new stuff I finally got the Magic Serum that I wanted to try forever, but it's like $80. I was like unsure to splurge or not. But I really wanted to try it. And then they had the freaking pink has them. Shall it tilbury wand that's been sold out forever? I wasn't planning on getting this, but I just immediately bought it because, okay, let's just go. I actually have the Magic Cream and I'm not the biggest fan, so I'm very excited to try the Serum out. I have way higher hopes for this. Also wearing white nakes trips if I have a list, I'm sorry. So far I was like a little bit of a scent, but it feels really nice. And it gives a pretty glow. I'll update if it makes me break out. I'm gonna do the rest of my makeup and then we'll try that this time. Okay, I finished my base with the cream products. Looking really good. Okay, now let's try the most exciting part. Okay, I'm gonna do like that much. The only thing I don't like about it is how much air is in it, but because it is like $40. I'm just watching one side. I actually really like the look of it, but one thing you have to do with these wands from Serum Tres are very close at every time you put it in your makeup bag or whatever, because if you don't, they will leak and it happens when we get it through the set. So just keep that in mind. Here's the powder that I got next to I've. I'm gonna use this one till I run out before I open the other one. Here's the finished makeup and everything. Personally, I think it's looking really good. Did do a little too much blush, but whatever. I don't know if it's like 100% worth it, because it's really expensive, but if you want to get it, it's not really not bad. I mean, I spend the money, and I'm happy.",POSITIVE,0.9987890124320984
